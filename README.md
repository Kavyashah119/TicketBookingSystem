Objective:

In this era, the majority of the people opt for online booking of their tour packages instead of heading to the concerned travels’ office. This program is thus developed keeping in mind the comfort of the user. A person has his/her unique username and password and can book, check or cancel his/her tourism package. Also, there are functionalities available for viewing the brochure, changing the password or logging out. 

Concepts Covered:

Pointers
File management
Conditional statements
Array
String operations
Looping
System() functions
Basic I/O console screen

Functionality:

Initially, the homepage appears on the screen with four options of signup, login, brochure, and exit. By selecting signup, the user is directed to the register zone, where he/she can signup himself/herself.
After registering successfully, the user is directed back to the homepage. By choosing the log-in option, the user gets logged in after the verification of his/her username and password.
Next is the series of options available for the user to book a package, check ticket, cancel ticket, change password, view brochure or logout user. By entering the option of his/her choice, the user can fully utilize the functionalities of this program.

Note: The program can work for a maximum of 100 people. However, this number could be increased or decreased as per the need.
